## LED Mania
Utilizes a 16 x 16 LED Matrix as well as 4 buttons and an arduino in order to be able to play stepmania. If you would like to replicate it you can change the button variables as well as the port variable in order to match your hardware and then run the Ring.ino and upload it to your arduino then run App.java on your computer. You will need to import processing. If you wish to add songs to the list add any songs to the songs folder such that it has the order Songs -> pack -> song. Will only play .mp3 files though any .sm file can be run.
